## 3. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### **3.1 File-Based IOCs**
- Suspicious executable: `invoice_update.exe`  
- File path: `C:\Users\Anna\AppData\Roaming\invoice_update.exe`  
- Hash (SHA-256): 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b  

### **3.2 Network IOCs**
- Malicious domain: `update-secure-check.com`  
- Outbound IP: `91.214.44.19`  
- Port: 443 (encrypted C2 traffic)  

### **3.3 Behavioral IOCs**
