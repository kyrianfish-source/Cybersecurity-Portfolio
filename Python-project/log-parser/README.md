# Simple Log Parser

## Purpose
This script filters log entries and prints only those that contain errors. It simulates basic log analysis used in cybersecurity.

## Python Concepts Used
- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Basic filtering

## How It Works
The script defines a function called `find_errors()` that loops through a list of logs.  
If the word **"ERROR"** appears in the entry, it prints it.

## Example Output
Found error: ERROR: Disk space low Found error: ERROR: Unauthorized access attempt

- How to loop through lists  
- How to filter data using conditionals  
- How to organize code using functions
