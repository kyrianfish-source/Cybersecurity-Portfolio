# Password Strength Checker

## Purpose
This script checks whether a password is strong or weak based on simple rules like length and character variety.

## Python Concepts Used
- Functions
- Conditionals
- String methods

## How It Works
The script defines a function called `check_password()` that evaluates:
- Password length  
- Whether the password contains only letters  

It returns a message describing the password strength.

## Example Output
Weak: Password too short 
Strong password

## What I Learned
- How to write and call functions  
- How to use conditionals to evaluate input  
- How to apply simple password rules
